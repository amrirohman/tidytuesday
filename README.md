***

Hi Everybody. Now, Iâ€™m doing data analysis in the Tidytuesday project.
Tidytuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. You can
visit [this page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) to get
more information. I hope in doing this activity I can train me as a
person who is able to understand data well.

I have produced several analyzes which you can see below.

### Thank You
